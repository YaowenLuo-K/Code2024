            Hacker Manifesto
            Written on January 8, 1986

            Another one got caught today, it's all over the papers. "Teenager
            Arrested in Computer Crime Scandal", "Hacker Arrested after Bank Tampering"...
            Damn kids. They're all alike.

            But did you, in your three-piece psychology and 1950's technobrain,
            ever take a look behind the eyes of the hacker? Did you ever wonder what
            made him tick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded him?
            I am a hacker, enter my world...
            Mine is a world that begins with school... I'm smarter than most of
            the other kids, this crap they teach us bores me...
            Damn underachiever. They're all alike.

            I'm in junior high or high school. I've listened to teachers explain
            for the fifteenth time how to reduce a fraction. I understand it. "No, Ms.
            Smith, I didn't show my work. I did it in my head..."
            Damn kid. Probably copied it. They're all alike.

            I made a discovery today. I found a computer. Wait a second, this is
            cool. It does what I want it to. If it makes a mistake, it's because I
            screwed it up. Not because it doesn't like me...
            Or feels threatened by me...
            Or thinks I'm a smart ass...
            Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be here...
            Damn kid. All he does is play games. They're all alike.

            And then it happened... a door opened to a world... rushing through the
            phone line like heroin through an addict's veins, an electronic pulse is
            sent out, a refuge from the day-to-day incompetencies is sought... a board is
            found.
            "This is it... this is where I belong..."
            I know everyone here... even if I've never met them, never talked to
            them, may never hear from them again... I know you all...
            Damn kid. Tying up the phone line again. They're all alike...

            You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been spoon-fed baby food at
            school when we hungered for steak... the bits of meat that you did let slip
            through were pre-chewed and tasteless. We've been dominated by sadists, or
            ignored by the apathetic. The few that had something to teach found us will-
            ing pupils, but those few are like drops of water in the desert.

            This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the
            beauty of the baud. We make use of a service already existing without paying
            for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and
            you call us criminals. We explore... and you call us criminals. We seek
            after knowledge... and you call us criminals. We exist without skin color,
            without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals.
            You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us
            and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals.

            Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that of 
            judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like.
            My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me
            for.

            I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto. You may stop this individual,
            but you can't stop us all... after all, we're all alike.

            First, let me talk about the cursor-effects in the Home page, which source from the
            code library shared by tholman on github <a href="https://github.com/tholman/cursor-effects/blob/master/src/fairyDustCursor.js">cursor-effects</a>.
            And the Grid layout method used in the entire website source from this website 
            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/CSS/css_grid_container.asp">Grid layout</a>.
           
            
            <span class="reading-title">Text reading analyze</span>

            For Assignment 1, I critically analyzed two readings: the Lowtech Manifesto and the 
            Hacker Manifesto. The Hacker Manifesto offers a unique and humorous perspective on 
            the misconceptions surrounding hackers. One notable quote, “This is our world now... 
            the world of the electron and switch,” reflects not only the hackers' reality but 
            also our contemporary existence. This insight prompted me to consider the ethical
            implications and criticisms within the digital landscape, highlighting how societal
            perceptions can shape narratives around technology and its users. Overall, both texts 
            challenge us to rethink our assumptions about technology and its impact on our lives.

            When I first started learning to code, I tried to use a simple and basic framework to 
            code the sketches I drew in class.
