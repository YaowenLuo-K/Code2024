In my Sko project, I aim to integrate the coding skills I’ve acquired into the field of graphic design, creating a synergy between code and visual aesthetics. This approach opens up new possibilities in graphic design by combining static visuals with dynamic and interactive elements. Coding knowledge can enhance the visual experience, making designs more engaging and interactive, a growing need in today's digital-focused design industry. By incorporating code into graphic design, I’m able to create more immersive and innovative visual experiences, offering unique solutions to fields such as digital advertising, interactive art installations, and user-centered design.

Looking ahead, I envision using code-based effects in future projects to produce dynamic digital posters and interactive designs. These digital posters, animated with code-driven effects, could be utilized for creative campaigns, event promotions, and online advertising, which increasingly demand fresh, engaging, and interactive visuals. This approach combines technical skills with creative innovation, allowing for more flexible and visually appealing design solutions. By enhancing graphic design with motion and interactivity, I can address the needs of clients seeking modern and adaptable visual content.

My Sko project also serves as a comprehensive record of my learning journey from weeks 1 to 12, allowing me to document each phase of knowledge gained in coding. By developing an inspiration library that includes code samples and design concepts, I aim to establish a resource that not only tracks my progress but also serves as a foundation for future projects. This inspiration library will act as a repository of creative ideas and coding techniques that I can build on and reference in my professional work, fostering continual growth in the intersection of code and graphic design.
